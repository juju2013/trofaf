# trofaf

trofaf is a super-simple *live* static blog engine from [PuerkitoBio](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/trofaf).

This is my modified version to serve [my online resume](http://recruitme.today).

Install using: `go get github.com/juju2013/trofaf`

## Description

It generates a static website from [*markdown* files][1] and front matter, and requires only a simple 3-directories structure to get going. It favors simplicity over features.

To get started, create the 3 subdirectories (you can look at the `example/` subdirectory for... an example): 

* posts 
* public 
* templates

trofaf only cares about `*.md` files in the posts directory, and about `*.amber` ([Amber templates][2]) in templates directory, `*.html` ([native Go templates][3]) files in no longer being used. It will watch for changes, creates or deletes on those files in these directories, and will re-generate automatically the website when required. This is the *live* part.

All files in the public directory are exposed by the web server. Posts in markdown format get translated to static html files at the root of the public directory. The html file name is an URL-friendly slug generated from the original markdown file name. There is no extension, so the URL looks clean and, uh, *modern*?

An RSS feed is automatically generated from a number of recent posts, and saved as a static XML file in the public directory.

There is no special template for an index page, the most recent post (based on the publication date found in the front matter of the markdown files) having a `IndexPage` tag - or without if there's none - is saved twice - once under its own html file, once under the index.html file, so that this is the page displayed when the root of the web server is requested.

When the site is (re-)generated, the public directory must be cleaned, because some posts may have been deleted. Subdirectories are left untouched (so that `css/` or `js/` directories can coexist peacefully), as well as hidden (dot) files, and some special files are also graced from the destruction (robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc., see gen.go).

It currently uses my fork of the amber package, in order to make a `fmttime(t time.Time, fmt string) string` function available in the templates. This function makes it possible to format the `PubTime` or `ModTime` fields in the same way that the stdlib's `time.Format()` works. This function is also made available to native Go templates (you can check the examples for usage).

## Command-line Options

The following options can be set at the command-line: 

* Port (-p) : the port number for the web server, defaults to 9000.
* GenOnly (-g) : generate the static site and exit.
* NoGen (-G) : prevents watching and live-generating the site. This is equivalent to running the static public directory.
* SiteName (-n) : the name of the web site, passed to the template.
* TagLine (-t) : a tag line for the web site, passed to the template.
* RecentPostsCount (-r) : the number of posts in the recent posts list, passed to the template and used for the RSS feed.
* BaseURL (-b) : the base URL of the web site, most likely the host name (i.e. http://www.mysite.com).

## Front matter

Like many static blog generators, trofaf uses *YAML front matter* to get metadata for a post. This is a complicated way to say that you have to add blocks of text like this at the start of your posts:

```
---
Title: My title
Description: My short-ish description of the post.
Author: Me
Date: 2013-07-14
Lang: en
---

# Here is my post!

Etc.
```

The three dashes delimit the front matter. It must be there, beginning and end. Between the dashes, the part before the colon `:` is the key, and after is the value. Simple as that.

Keys `Title`, `Description`, `Author`, `Date` and `Lang` are mandatory. 

Valid date formats are `2006-01-02`, `2006-01-02 15h` (or `2006-01-02 8h`), `2006-01-02 15:04` (or `2006-01-02 8:17`) or the RCF3339 format (`2013-08-06T17:48:01-05:00`).

Key `Template` can be used to tell trofaf which template (.amber) to use. If not found, `default.amber` will be used.

You can use any `xxx` key value in the template if it's defined in the front matter.
